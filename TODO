TODO List
=========

Priorities:
- high: It should be done before the end of the GSOC project
- medium: It would be great if it would be done
- low: not so urgent. We could get someone else to work on that ;-)

General
-------
Main objective: get UDD into a state where it can be used for QA purposes.
That's the first step towards world domination! (Universe is next! CvE)
- (prio: high) clarify debian-backports-etch and debian-volatile-etch. HE
  will talk to Ganneff.
- (prio: high) user documentation, on the Debian wiki.
  - tables structure, in a relatively friendly format
  - some example queries
- (prio: medium) primary key for tables which have none yet
- (prio: medium) should we give access from alioth?

packages/sources
----------------
- (prio: medium) Add support for keeping history of Packages and Sources in
  separate tables.

bugs.debian.org
---------------
- (prio: medium) compare rt_affects_* with bts.tz.net
- (prio: medium) generate output using bts2ldap format, and check that the
  result matches a fresh bts2ldap run done by Lucas
- (prio: medium) Optimize bugs importing (again)

Other data sources
------------------
- (prio: medium) DEHS
- (prio: low) MIA
- (prio: low) debtags
- (prio: low) wanna-build
- (prio: low) edos.debian.net
- (prio: low) version numbers, diffs and bugs for each package for each
  derivative distro 
- (prio: low) import data about Ubuntu bugs on launchpad. Lucas already
  has a script importing this data to an SQLite DB (running on merkel).
