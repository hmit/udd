TODO List
=========

Priorities:
- high: It should be done before the end of the GSOC project
- medium: It would be great if it would be done
- low: not so urgent. We could get someone else to work on that ;-)

General
-------
- (prio: medium) do we want a "version" type?
  ACTION: talk with rleigh

packages/sources
----------------
- (prio: medium) Add support for keeping history of Packages and Sources in
  separate tables. (zack wants that, but shouldn't we use snapshot.d.o for that
  instead?)
-  (prio: high) configuration is currently annoying to do, because of the way
   we describe each distribution separately. It would be easier to have a tree-like
   description of what we want to import.

bugs.debian.org
---------------
- (prio: medium) Optimize bugs importing (again)
  posix_fadvise?

upload-history
--------------
- (prio: medium) < Rhonda> lucas: Can you propably add bpo upload history to udd?
  godog prepared the data in http://qa.debian.org/~filippo/bpo/

Other data sources
------------------
- (prio: low) DEHS
  table schema:
  package
  release # unstable, experimental
  status # status (outdated, uptodate, newer, error) for unstable
  version # version in unstable as seen by dehs
  mangled_version # version in unstable after transformation
  upstream # upstream version as seen by the unstable watch file
  url # url for the detected tarball
  last_check # 
  Rest of the work pending an easy way to access the data (Atomo64 not really
  willing to help, apparently)
- (prio: low) MIA
- (prio: low) wanna-build
- (prio: low) packages-arch-specific
- (prio: low) edos.debian.net
- watch files + DEHS (andreas tille is interested)
- DDTP translations (andreas tille is interested as well)
- screenshots.d.n (andreas tille again)
- NEW, from http://ftp-master.debian.org/new.822 (andreas :-))
