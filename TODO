TODO List
=========

Priorities:
- high: It should be done before the end of the GSOC project
- medium: It would be great if it would be done
- low: not so urgent. We could get someone else to work on that ;-)

General
-------
Main objective: get UDD into a state where it can be used for QA purposes.
That's the first step towards world domination!
- (prio: high) Set up cronjobs so that the database is updated on a regular
  basis (it's still possible to continue to use udd-test for development
  purposes). Document how frequently the DB is updated.
- (prio: high) Start a basic website at http://udd.debian.net/ using CGIs that
  display the results of some queries in a text/machine-parseable format (one
  query per page).
- (prio: high) Update the pages on the wiki so that they reflect what was
  decided / the current status of everything.
- (prio: high) add a way to mark the date of the last successful update in a
  file, for each data source, so we can answer the "how up-to-date is this
  data?" question.
- (prio: high) Write/update documentation about the system, and how to use it.

packages/sources
----------------
- (prio: medium) Add support for keeping history of Packages and Sources in
  separate tables.

bugs.debian.org
---------------
- (prio: high) compare what's imported with what's available on
  http://bts.turmzimmer.net/details.php. Do the results match?
- (prio: high) deal with archived bugs. They should be imported as well, but
  probably less frequently. How do we deal with bugs that were archived /
  unarchived since the last run?
- (prio: high) user tags
- (prio: medium) generate output using bts2ldap format, and check that the
  result matches a fresh bts2ldap run done by Lucas

popcon
------
- (prio: high) fix Ubuntu's popcon? (is it broken?)
  16:55 < Neronus> Great. ubuntu popcon raw data is broken.
- (prio: high) rename "name" to "package". (and fix the views accordingly)

Other data sources
------------------
- (prio: medium) do history of uploads (coordinate with godog on the format)
- (prio: medium) DEHS
- (prio: medium) carnivore
- (prio: low) WNPP (see collab-qa/orphan-list)
- (prio: low) MIA
- (prio: low) debtags
- (prio: low) wanna-build
- (prio: low) lintian
- (prio: low) edos.debian.net
- (prio: low) version numbers, diffs and bugs for each package for each
  derivative distro 
- (prio: low) import data about Ubuntu bugs on launchpad. Lucas already
  has a script importing this data to an SQLite DB (running on merkel).
