TODO List
=========

Priorities:
- high: It should be done before the end of the GSOC project
- medium: It would be great if it would be done
- low: not so urgent. We could get someone else to work on that ;-)

General
-------
- (prio: high) make udd.py use a default config file, which can be overriden by "-f configfile".
- (prio: high) find a way to only send mail after crons when there's something "interesting" to report
  + log timing info to a file (udd.log?), for both update and run
  + hide the uninteresting errors (like unable to open /org/bugs.debian.org/versions/pkg)
- (prio: medium) do we want a "version" type?

packages/sources
----------------
- (prio: medium) Add support for keeping history of Packages and Sources in
  separate tables. (zack wants that, but shouldn't we use snapshot.d.o for that
  instead?)
- (prio: low, not sure if it's a good idea) Incremental updates, not full
  imports (use that to trigger incremental bugs.d.o imports (for affects_*
  updates)
- (prio: low) Add a pkg composite type (text version, text name). The
   operator '=' used with type text should only check the package name,
   with another pkg should check both pkg and version. Should be pretty
   DWIM.

bugs.debian.org
---------------
- (prio: medium) Optimize bugs importing (again)

Other data sources
------------------
- (prio: medium) DEHS
- (prio: low) MIA
- (prio: low) wanna-build
- (prio: low) packages-arch-specific
- (prio: low) edos.debian.net
