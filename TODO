TODO List
=========

Priorities:
- high: It should be done before the end of the GSOC project
- medium: It would be great if it would be done
- low: not so urgent. We could get someone else to work on that ;-)

General
-------
Main objective: get UDD into a state where it can be used for QA purposes.
That's the first step towards world domination! (Universe is next! CvE)
- (prio: high) clarify debian-backports-etch and debian-volatile-etch. HE
  will talk to Ganneff.
- (prio: high) add a (robust, working) lockfile system so that the same
  update process doesn't run twice.

packages/sources
----------------
- (prio: medium) Add support for keeping history of Packages and Sources in
  separate tables.

bugs.debian.org
---------------
- (prio: high) compare rt_affects_* with bts.tz.net
- (prio: medium) warning when running: read_usertags is deprecated at
  /org/udd.debian.net/udd/src/udd/bugs_gatherer.pl line 115
- (prio: medium) generate output using bts2ldap format, and check that the
  result matches a fresh bts2ldap run done by Lucas
- (prio: medium) Optimize bugs importing
- (prio: high) Tricky problem with affects_*: some bugs (e.g #245548) were
  filed against an experimental version, and fixed in that experimental
  version. So the BTS doesn't know if they affect unstable or not. We mark
  them as affecting unstable, currently. Maybe we need a tri-state found,
  fixed, unknown.

Other data sources
------------------
- (prio: medium) DEHS
- (prio: low) MIA
- (prio: low) debtags
- (prio: low) wanna-build
- (prio: low) edos.debian.net
- (prio: low) version numbers, diffs and bugs for each package for each
  derivative distro 
- (prio: low) import data about Ubuntu bugs on launchpad. Lucas already
  has a script importing this data to an SQLite DB (running on merkel).
