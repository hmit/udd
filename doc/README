Ultimate Debian Database (UDD)
==============================

The UDD project is an effort to collect data about the Debian in an SQL
to support Quality Assurance (QA) work.

It started in 2008 as a Google Summer of Code project, the student being
Christian von Essen, who wrote most of the code, mentor being Lucas Nussbaum,
and co-mentors being Stefano Zacchiroli and Marc Brockschmidt.

Installation
------------
- Download the code (from SVN)
- install postgresql-8.3 python-syck python-psycopg2 libdbi-perl
  libparams-validate-perl libdbd-pg-perl
- setup postgresql-8.3 (see /usr/share/doc/postgresql-common/README.Debian.gz)
  and create a database (naming it 'udd' will make things easier later)
- edit config.yaml (see README.config for details)
- setup the DB: psql udd < sql/setup.sql

Usage
-----
- run ./udd.py <configuration> update [ fetches the external data ]
- run ./udd.py <configuration> run [ import the data into the DB ]
FIXME document all commands.

Detailed information
--------------------
The data we import comes from different sources. Each source has a specific
type (e.g. popcon). For each such type, there is a program to import this data
into the database. These programs are called gatherers. Furthermore, there is
an optional way to update the data (i.e. get it from the source) for each
source.

Each source has its own documentation. See doc/sources/.
