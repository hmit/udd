This guide tells you how to start UDD from scratch.

I assume that you've downloaded the code and setup and sql database.

After making changes to the configuration (see config.README),
you have to call udd-dispatch.py <configuration> setup (assuming that you didn't
change the name of the setup source) (NOTE: This procedure is likely
to change, as we are planning to have each source setup its own tables).
After that, you can start importing sources. Keep in mind, though, that some
sources depend on the existence of other sources. Currently, this means that
packages/sources have to imported prior to popcon. To import sources, you first
call
udd-dispatch.py <configuration> <source name 1> [source name 2 [source name 3
...]].
If you want to update your data before you start importing it, you call
udd-update.py <configuration> <source name 1> [source name 2 [source name 3
...]].

If you want to drop start cleanly and drop all tables/views from the database,
you have to call
udd-dispatch <configuration> delete (again, assuming that you did not change
the name of the delete source). An alternateive to this is to just drop
the complete database via dropdb)
