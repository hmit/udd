Howto test UDD on your site:

You need a postgres-db, and access to the sources you want to import into your DB.

The next step is to put the scripts and configuration somewhere. It doesn't
really matter where.

There is one file you have to edit/create new: a configuration file. This file
has to be in YAML format. See config.README for information about this file,
and have a look at test.yaml in the src directory.

For all things you do, you run udd-dispatch.py <config-path> source1 [source2
source3 ...]. config-path has to be the path of the configuration file you
want to use. source1 through sourceN have to be sources specified in the
configuration file.

Before doing anything else, you have to run "udd-dispatch.py <config> setup",
which will create the necessary tables in your database.

From here, you can start importing source into your database. For each SOURCE,
you run udd-dispatch.py <config> SOURCE.

Now your sources should be included in your db.
