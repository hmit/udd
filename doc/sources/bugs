DESCRIPTION:
  The bugs source type imports the data from bugs.debian.org. For this, the
  perl module Debbugs is used.
  We device bugs into two parts: On the one hand, there are unarchived bugs,
  and on the other hand, there are archived bugs.
  For each bug, we save the following information:
    id
    package(s) affected by the bug
    the source of the package affected by the bug (if existing)
    the date of the arrival of the bug
    the bug's severity
    the submitter
    the owner
    the subject of the mail submitting the bug
    the date the bug has been modified the last time
    if it affects stable, testing and unstable
    if it is archived
    what versions the bug was found and fixed in
    what tags belong to the bug
    which bugs the bug was merged with

  Furthermore, for each user found at bugs.debian.org, we save the usertags
  they have set

CONFIGURATION:
  archived: Should the gatherer import archived or unarchived bugs?
