DESCRIPTION
  The popcon source type handles the popcon data delivered by debian and ubuntu.

  Specifically, the raw, compressed popcon data is read (e.g. from
  http://popcon.debian.org/all-popcon-results.txt.gz.

  For each line in the file, we import:
    the package name
    the scores for the package (recent, vote, old, nofiles)
    the sum of the above
  See http://popcon.debian.org/all-popcon-results.txt.gz for more information
  about the format.

  Furthermore, we save the number of submissions in the row with package name
  '_submissions'.

CONFIGURATION:
  path: The path of the popcon raw data to be read
  distribution: To which distribution does this popcon data belong?
