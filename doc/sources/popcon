DESCRIPTION
  The popcon source type handles the popcon data delivered by debian and ubuntu.

  http://popcon.debian.org/all-popcon-results.txt.gz.

  For each line in the file, we import:
    the package name
    the scores for the package (recent, vote, old, nofiles)
    the sum of the above
  See http://popcon.debian.org/all-popcon-results.txt.gz for more information
  about the format.

  Furthermore, we save the number of submissions in the row with package name
  '_submissions'.

  From this data, three tables are filled:
   * One table with the name specified by the 'table' node
   * One table with '_src_max' appended to the first table
   * One table with '_src_average' appended to the first table

  The first one contains the raw popcon data. For the other tables,
  please see the source code of the gatherer.
