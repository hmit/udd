DESCRIPTION
  The carnivore source type handles the data provided by the carnivore
  QA-subproject, aiming to connect several identities of the same
  person (ie, different mail addresses, variants of the same name,
  OpenPGP key IDs) with each other.

  The imported data is the carnivore report created on a regular basis
  in merkel.debian.org:/org/qa.debian.org/carnivore (see the README
  files there for more information on the project).

  We import all relevant carnivore data, by assigning a unique integer
  ID to each carnivore entity (who can have several names, mail addresses
  and keys) ad then pushing all that data to the DB. Four tables are
  created:
   * emails-table: (ID, mail) mapping
   * names-table: (ID, name) mapping
   * keys-table: (ID, key) mapping
   * login-table: (ID, login) mapping, login being the debian.org login

  _keys and _login are only set for full Debian Developers.

CONFIGURATION:
  path: The path of the carnivore report to be read
  emails-table, names-tables, key-table, login-table: The names of the
   database tables used for the different mappings
