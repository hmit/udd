DESCRIPTION
  The lintian source type handles lintian log files.

  The raw data of a (full, hopefully) lintian run, for example from
  http://lintian.debian.org/lintian.log, is parsed, all important
  bits get extracted and put in the DB.

  Each emitted tag is imported to the DB, together with it's type
  (one of error, warning, information, experimental or overriden),
  the affected package and the package type (source, udeb and NULL
  for binary packages).

CONFIGURATION:
  path: The path of the lintian raw data to be read
  table: The name of the database table
