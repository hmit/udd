DESCRIPTION:
  The source source type handles Sources.gz files of distribution using the
  distribution scheme coming from Debian (e.g. Ubuntu).

  If $d is the directory, then the gatherer looks for Sources.gz files
  in all directories of the form $d/$c/source/, where $c is an element
  of the list specified by 'components'.
  If no such directory exists, the gatherer prints a warning message, and
  ignores the directory. Otherwise, it decompresses the Sources.gz
  file and imports the information which is found.
  At the moment, the follwing fields are imported:

  If a field is found, which is not one of those, a warning is printed.
  The first 5 fields are considered mandatory, i.e. if one of those
  fields is missing, an exception is raised, and the program gets aborted.
  If one of the other fields is missing, their value is NULL in the database.
