To check if vacuum is working:
SELECT relname, reltuples, relpages FROM pg_class ORDER BY relpages DESC;
(thanks Q_)


In case a transaction is waiting in idle mode you should do the following:

 1. psql udd -c "select * from dsa_kill_all_idle_transactions();"
 2. kill running importers



Short explanation of the files in this directory:
-------------------------------------------------

setup.sql contains the code to generate a pristine UDD db from scratch.
upgrade.sql lists the commands needed to upgrade a running UDD db. You
can't run it, but you can copy-paste from it.
Under the current scheme, there should be no other files, so all your
SQL code should go into setup.sql and upgrade.sql.
